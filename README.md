  **Description:**

  An e-commerce website architecture typically includes components such as:

  - **Frontend**: User interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.
  - **Backend**: Server-side application handling business logic, often using frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js.
  - **Database**: Storage for product information, user data, and transactions, using systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
  - **Payment Gateway**: Integration with services like PayPal or Stripe to process payments.
  - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Ensures fast delivery of static content to users worldwide.
  - **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure scalability and reliability.

  **Non-Functional Requirements:**

  - **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased traffic during peak times.
  - **Security**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities and secure handling of user data.
  - **Performance**: Fast page load times and efficient processing of user requests.
  - **Reliability**: High availability with minimal downtime.
